# Various Python Algorithms 

### All these algorithms have been implemented in Python (for education purposes)

These are for education purposes only. There are many implementations of sorts in the Python standard library that are much better for performance reasons.
For some algorithms, various examples from various sources or authors have been included. This is just to show the various ways to code the algo.
